#Heygo-App

## General info
Dear Heygo Team,

It was pleasure to create this app. Main goal for me was to learn 
and practice Styled-Components. It was like fighting with Ivan Drago.

I started with proper planning to make it fast and make it pretty(code and UI)

I added test to axios to check connection with API
